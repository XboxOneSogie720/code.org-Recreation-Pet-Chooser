This is a simple and slightly modified re-creation of the Pet Chooser app from one of my classes in school, made for iOS!

To install, simply download the latest ipa from the releases tab, and sideload either by installing through Sideloadly,
AltStore, Filza, or something similar.

Once it's installed, open the app and it will work!
